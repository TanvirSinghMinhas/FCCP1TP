            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p id="image-div">Barack Hussein Obama II was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 4, 1961. Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr., was born of Luo ethnicity in 
                Nyanza Province, Kenya. Obama Sr. grew up herding goats in Africa and 
                eventually earned a scholarship that allowed him to leave Kenya and pursue his dreams of going to college in Hawaii. Obamaâ€™s mother, Ann Dunham, was born on an Army base in Wichita, Kansas, during World War II. 
                With this and many other issues, Obama grew up in a hostile enviornment.
